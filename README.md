# MinimalVulkanAppInC

**Warning**: Before building the app, make sure to adjust the `vki` and `vkl` variables in the `build.bat` file to reflect the path where you installed the Vulkan SDK on your system. 

This repository contains the source code for a minimal Vulkan app written in C. The app demonstrates basic Vulkan concepts and renders a single red triangle on a yellow background.
